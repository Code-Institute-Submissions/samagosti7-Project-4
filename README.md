Final database structure:

```python
class Booking(models.Model):
    booking_id = models.UUIDField(
        primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False)
    user = models.ForeignKey(
        User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="user_bookings")
    booking_date = models.DateField(auto_now=False)
    booking_time = models.TimeField(auto_now=False)
    booking_comments = models.TextField(max_length=200, blank=True)
    created_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    guest_count = models.IntegerField()
    status = models.IntegerField(choices=STATUS, default=0)

# 2. Features

[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

### All Pages
- The navigation bar is placed at the top of all pages. The navigation bar is dynamic in that meaning depending on if the user is logged in or not the options will change.
- If the user is not logged in the navigation bar will look like this:
![user_not_logged_in](documentation_assets/images/navbar_not_logged_in.png)
- If the user is logged in the navigation bar will look like this:
![user_logged_in](documentation_assets/images/navbar_logged_in.png)
- The footer is placed at the bottom of each page with social media icons. When hovering over them it creates a zoom effect giving the user more of an experience. These icons will open the links in a new tab.

- The restaurant logo is also placed at the top of all pages. Clicking on it will also direct the user to the home page.
- Animated background, to give more of a user experience instead of a plain static background.

### Register Page
- A simple signup form that requires the user to enter a unique email address and a password. The password must be entered again for confirmation, this must match the already entered password above.
- A message to prompt the user that if an account is already been created they can click the sign-in hyperlink to be redirected to the sign-in page.
- If the user enters an email address that has already been registered, the user is prompted by an error message.
![email_validation_error](documentation_assets/images/signup_email_validation.png)
- If the user enters a password that is not secure, the user will be prompted by a message.
![password_too_common](documentation_assets/images/password_too_common.png)
- If the user enters both passwords that do not match, the user is prompted by a message.
![signup_email_validation](documentation_assets/images/signup_email_validation.png)
- Once the user has successfully signed up, this will automatically log in and direct the user to the create profile page.

### Login Page
- A login form that requires the user to enter their email address and password that they used when signing up to the site.
- A message to prompt the user that if an account has not been created they can click the signup hyperlink to be redirected to the signup page.
- If the user enters in the wrong credentials, a message is displayed to the user.
![signup_email_validation](documentation_assets/images/login_validation.png)

### Logout Page
- When clicking logout from the navigation bar, the user is redirected to a sign-out page to confirm their action.

### Landing Page
- A simple but elegant banner to give the user a sense of the restaurant.
- A book now button that directs the user to create a booking page. If the user has not logged in it will prompt the user to register or log in first.
- A short introduction to describe the restaurant.

# 4. Testing

[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

### Chrome Developer Tools
Used Chrome dev tools to test styling and responsivity.

### W3C Validator Tools
#### HTML:
I used [W3C Markup](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input+with_options) to check for any html errors.

I had an error on the following templates:
![base.html_error](error pics)

I fixed them like this:
![base.html_fix](fix pics)


#### CSS:
I used [W3C CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to check for any errors in my CSS stylesheet.

I had no errors in my CSS file:
![css_validation](documentation_assets/images/css_validation.png)

### JavaScript:
I used [JS Hint](https://jshint.com/) to check for any errors within my JavaScript script tags. 

I had no errors in my JavaScript files:
![javascript_validation](documentation_assets/images/javascript_validation.png)

### Python:
I used [PEP8 online](http://pep8online.com/) to check for any errors in my Python files. 

 errors:
![urls_errors](error pics)

Fixed:
![urls_fixed_errors](fixed pics)

There were also "line too long" errors within my env.os file but I have chosen to ignore these as any attempts to edit them blew up the entire site.

# 6. Deployment

[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

I used the terminal to deploy my project locally. To do this I had to:
1. Create a repository on GitHub.
2. Clone the repository on your chosen source code editor (GitPod in my case) using the clone link.
3. Open the terminal within GitPod
4. Enter "python3 manage.py runserver into the terminal.
5. Go to local host address on my web browser.
6. All locally saved changes will show up here.

For the final deployment to Heroku, I had to:
1. Uncomment the PostgreSQL databse from my settings.py file.
2. Set debug = False in my settings.py file.
3. Commit and push all files to GitHub
3. In Heroku, remove the DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC config var.
4. In the deploy tab, go to the manual deploy sections and click deploy branch.

I had an issue with the deployed site and the CSS was not showing on my screen.
This was rectified by restarting all dynos in Heroku.
